Abstract: *Despite ongoing efforts to defend neural classifiers from adversarial attacks, they remain vulnerable, especially to unseen attacks. In contrast, humans are difficult to be cheated by subtle manipulations, since we make judgments only based on essential factors. Inspired by this observation, we attempt to model label generation with essential label-causative factors and incorporate label-non-causative factors to assist data generation. For an adversarial example, we aim to discriminate the perturbations as non-causative factors and make predictions only based on the label-causative factors. Concretely, we propose a casual diffusion model (CausalDiff) that adapts diffusion models for conditional data generation and disentangles the two types of casual factors by learning towards a novel casual information bottleneck objective. Empirically, CausalDiff has significantly outperformed state-of-the-art defense methods on various unseen attacks, achieving an average robustness of 86.39\% (+4.01\%) on CIFAR-10, 56.25\% (+3.13\%) on CIFAR-100, and 82.62\% (+4.93\%) on GTSRB (German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark).*



## Requirements

The code is achieved with Python 3.7.13. To install the required packages, run:

  ```bash

  pip install -r requirements.txt

  ```



## Pre-trained CausalDiff

Note that you have to put all the datasets in the `datasest` directory.



For the trained CausalDiff model on CIFAR-10, you can download them from the following links:
